1. Define the Scope & Goals
Target users: Patients, doctors, healthcare providers?

Core functions: Symptom checking, appointment scheduling, basic medical advice?

Limitations: Legal compliance (HIPAA, GDPR), no direct diagnosis?

2. Choose the Tech Stack
Programming Language: Python

Libraries & Tools:

NLP: spaCy, NLTK, or Transformers

Machine Learning: scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch

Chat Interface: Rasa, ChatterBot, OpenAI GPT

Database: PostgreSQL, MongoDB for user data storage

API Integration: FastAPI, Flask for backend services

3. Design the Conversation Flow
Greeting & user identification

Collect symptoms & health concerns

Provide responses (triage advice, health information)

Route users to professionals if necessary

Follow-up messages or reminders

4. Implement Natural Language Processing (NLP)
Preprocess text (tokenization, stemming, stopword removal)

Use named entity recognition (NER) for symptom identification

5. Develop the Chatbot Backend
Create an API to process user queries

Store conversation history securely

Maintain a symptom-to-advice database

Ensure encryption and privacy compliance

6. Train & Test the Model
Gather medical datasets for symptom analysis

Fine-tune chatbot responses with real-world cases

Test with different queries to improve accuracy
